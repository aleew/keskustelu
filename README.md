Purpose of this project is to build a tool for forums to allow easier checking of and referencing to other comments on same site on different threads.

Preferred screen are wide (Fountain large-column) so that browse and commenting screens are horizontally adjacent. On smaller screens they are vertically adjacent.

Primary navigation method is via links since browsing is supposed to happen on the site where tool's implemented. Allow-Control-Allow-Origin header would enable browsing of other sites, I suppose. There's 'address bars' implemented however. They have at the moment bit eccentric logic: after placing focus on one, the keyboard button pressed becomes the 'go' key. So after focusing on the input, press 'Enter'.

Keskustelu translates to conversation. This tool hopefully enables more constructive statements and enlightening conversations.
